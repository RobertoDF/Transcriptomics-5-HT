               "We analysed the single-cell scRNA-seq dataset provided by the Allen Institute {Yao, 2023 #2828} "
                "focusing on the expression of Htrs RNA across approximately 4 million brain cells. The scRNA-seq dataset comprehensively encompassed all known 14 Htr subtypes. "
               f"{round(((exp>threshold_expression).sum(axis=1).astype(bool).sum()/exp.shape[0])*100,2)}% of cells expressed RNA of at least one Htr. "
               f"Prevalence of Htrs across the entire dataset was considerably different ranging from {expression_total.min()}% of {expression_total.idxmin()} "
               f"to {expression_total.max()}% of {expression_total.idxmax()} (Figure 1A). RNA of 6 Htr was found in less than 2.5% of the cells "
               f"({', '.join(expression_total[expression_total < 2.5].index.values)}). On the other hand, RNA of Htr1f, Htr2a and Htr2c was present in "
               f"at least 1 every 5 cells. Average amount of RNA expression also varied across receptors (Supplementary Figure 1A). "
               f"Interestingly, the variation in amount of RNA shared ≈half of the variability with the prevalence, i.e., receptors found in more cells also tended "
               f"to be expressed more at the single cell dimension. "
               f"Beside the prevalence and amount of expression, also the distribution was considerably different. This is exemplified "
               f"by looking at the distribution of the Htr1 and Htr2 families across different cell type neighborhoods (Figure 1B). "
               f"Neighborhoods were defined both by location and neurotransmitter (Supplementary Figure 1B, Table 1). "
               f"When looking at the UMAP distributions for individual Htr, considerable differences were present also within family (Supplementary Figure 2). "
               f"We analyzed this differences more in detail by grouping cells by "
               f"neurotransmitter, neighborhoods or class. These categorizarions divided cells in a higlhy skewed manner (Supplementary Figure 1C), "
               f"for example when looking at groups by neurotransmitter release, "
               f"3 groups (Glut, Gaba and unassigned) made up for almost the totality of cells ({round((joined.groupby('neurotransmitter').size() / joined.shape[0])[['','Glut','GABA']].sum()*100,2)}%). "
               f"Expectedly, the vast majority of cells was classified as excitatory (Glut) ({total_cells_by_neurotransmitter['Glut']}%) and "
               f"≈1 every 5 cells was found to release GABA ({total_cells_by_neurotransmitter['GABA']}%). All the other neurotransmitter were found in less than 1% of the cells, "
               f"in particular, 5-HT releasing neurons (Sero) were found in only {total_cells_by_neurotransmitter['Sero']}% of the cells. "
               f"Pattern of Htrs expression across different neurotransmitter groups exhibited a relatevely high Pearson correlation coefficient "
               f"(r={round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.stack().mean(),2)}±{round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.stack().sem(),2)}). "
               f"Sero and cholinergic neurons (Chol) showed the most distinct patterns of expression with respectively r={round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.mean()['Sero'],2)}±"
               f"{round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.sem()['Sero'],2)} and "
               f"r={round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.mean()['Chol'], 2)}{round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.sem()['Chol'],2)}. "
               f"To evaluate the uniqueness of Htrs RNA expression per group we employed a Random Forest Classifier aiming at decoding the grouping variable from the Htrs expression (Figure 1C). "
               f"Overall accuracy of the model was {round(accuracy_neurotransmitter,2)}%. "
               f"Reflecting the correlation analysis, Sero and Chol were among the groups with higher true positive (TP) rate (Sero={round(cm_neurotransmitter['Sero']['Sero'], 2)}%, "
               f"Chol={round(cm_neurotransmitter['Chol']['Chol'], 2)}%). Cells not expressing any Htr were also "
               f"identified succesfully (no-Htr={round(cm_neurotransmitter[''][''], 2)}%). Noradrenaline (Nora) and glycine (GABA-Glyc) releasing neurons "
               f"were also identified almost half of the times (Nora={round(cm_neurotransmitter['Nora']['Nora'], 2)}% and "
               f"GABA-Glyc={round(cm_neurotransmitter['GABA-Glyc']['GABA-Glyc'], 2)}%). "
               f"To understand the contribution of each Htr in each prediction "
               f"we calculated the mean absolute SHAP values for each receptor and neurotransmitter. The shap values associated with the mean prevalence enable us "
               f"to understand which are the defining features of each grop. Here we can see, for example, that the identification of Sero neurons "
               f"is determined mainly by expression of Htr1a and Chol neurons by Htr4 and Htr5b. Absence of expression can also contribute to the classification, e.g., "
               f"Htr4 is rarely expressed by Nora neurons. "
               f"When looking at different neighborhoods the accuracy of the model was {round(accuracy_neighborood,2)}%. "
               f"The model could differentiate best the NN-IMN-GC, TH-EPI-Glut and Pallium-Glut groups (NN-IMN-GC={round(cm_neighborood['NN-IMN-GC']['NN-IMN-GC'], 2)}%, "

               f"NN-IMN-GC includes all the cells not releasing any neurotransmitter, their classification is thereofre predictably strongly influenced by absence of any Htr. On the other hand, "
               f"TH-EPI-Glut cells were characterized by high expression of Htr7 and low expression of Htr2a and Htr4. "
               f"Across classes, differences in Htrs expression were even more evident (Figure 1D). {report_class.loc['recall'][report_class.loc['recall']>.4].shape[0]} groups could be identified "
               f"with a TP rate > 40%: {formatted_class_string} (Supplementary Figure 3B). 04 DG-IMN Glut were charachterized by high expression of Htr4 and absence of, the usually prevalent, Htr2c. Similarly, 05 OB-IMN GABA cells "
               f"showed virtual absence of Htr2c but expression of Htr1f; 09 CNU-LGE GABA cells show high Htr1b and low Htr7; 17 MH-LH Glut exhibited high levels of Htr5b and Htr4"
               f"; 18 TH Glut showed high levels of Htr7 and virtual absence of Htr4; 22 MB-HB Sero, miroring the results showed by Sero neurons, were charachterized by Htr1a; at last, 34 Immune cells "
               f"were identified by absence of any Htr expression. "
               f"Correlation between Htrs expression across the totality of cells ranged from {corr_by_cell.min().values[0]} ({'-'.join(corr_by_cell.idxmin())}) to {corr_by_cell.max().values[0]} "
               f"({'-'.join(corr_by_cell.idxmax())}). "
               f"Considerable correlation was also found for the {corr_by_cell.index[1]} (r={corr_by_cell.iloc[1].values[0]}) and "
               f"{corr_by_cell.index[2]} (r={corr_by_cell.iloc[2].values[0]}) pairs (Figure 1E). Interestingly, correlation patterns were not stable across neighboroods "
               f"(Supplementary Figure 4A). For example, Pallium-Glut exhibited a negative correlation between Htr4-Htr2a not evident from the entire dataset. Of note, TH-EPI-Glut showed the "
               f"highest absolute correlation across all neighboroods with r={correlation_TH_EPI.max().max()} between Htr5b-Htr4 and a unique negative correlation between Htr5b-Htr7 and Htr4-Htr7. "
               "To investigate the underlying cause of the correlations we investigated colocalization between Htrs using the same stringent threshold used by the original authors of the dataset {Yao, 2023 #2828}. "
               f"Across the entire dataset we observed that the most expressed genes, Htr1f and Htr2c, were often colocalized with other genes (Figure 1G). This was a driving factor for correlation. "
               f"After dividing the dataset across neighboroods we noticed that Pallium-Glut and TH-EPI-Glut were the most peculiar groups. they showed the lowest Htr2c colocalization, i.e., "
               f"cells expressing any other Htr colocalized with Htr2c <20%, in all other groups Htr2c colocalization was at least 40%. Moreover, Pallium-Glut was the only group showing "
               f" a uniquely low Htr7 colocalization ({coloc_matrix.loc['Htr7', 'Pallium-Glut']}%) on the other hand, TH-EPI-Glut showed the highest "
               f"({coloc_matrix.loc['Htr7', 'TH-EPI-Glut']}%).  "
               f"Only rarely a cell was found to express uniquely one Htr, {round(at_least_2_receptors.mean().values[0], 2)}±{round(at_least_2_receptors.sem().values[0], 2)}% "
               f"of cells indeed expressed at least "
               f"2 Htrs (Figure 1F). Surprisingly, {round(at_least_5_receptors.mean().values[0], 2)}±{round(at_least_5_receptors.sem().values[0], 2)}% of cells expressed at least 5 Htrs. "
               f"The extensive expression across different Htr classes and the considerable coexpression within cells point at the complexity of the 5-HT system even "
               f"at the single cell dimension. "
               f"To facilitate an understanding of the downstream  cellular effects "
               f"of 5-HT we aggregated receptors according to their main intracellular effector. We aggregated Htr1 and Htr5 due to their inhibitory effect (cAMP decrerase),"
               f" Htr4, Htr6 and Htr7 because "
               f"of the shared downstream effect of increasing cAMP. Htr2 is the only one that causes an Ca2+ increase while Htr3 is the only ionotropic receptor. For each cell we determined the "
               f"the principal pathway activated by 5-HT by looking at the amount of RNA of each Htr. Afterwards we divided the cells across the different neighborhoods (Figure 1H). "
               f"Ht3 were present only in a small minority of cortical inhibitory neurons."
               f"In the telencephalon, the absolute majority of both Pallium-Glut "
               f"and Subpallium-Gaba cells were linked to Htr1/5, ≈one quarter of cells instead featured Htr2 as primary effector. Subcortical cells exhibited "
               f"a more balanced proportion without any absolute majority and a considerable presence of Htr4/6/7.. "
               f" In the following sections we will take a deeper look at "
               "Htrs grouped by effector and we will take advantage of the spatial information provided by the MERFISH dataset of {Zhang, 2023 #2887} regarding 9 Htrs. ",

                          "Highest expression was found in 5-HT neurons of the mid- and hindbrain (class 22 MB-HB Sero, Figure 2C), nonetheless, cortical excitatory neurons (01 IT-ET Glut) "
                          "had the higher absolute number of cells expressing Ht1a. To pinpoint the spatial location we first identified the clusters highly enriched with Htr1a RNA with "
