               "We analysed the single-cell scRNA-seq dataset provided by the Allen Institute {Yao, 2023 #2828} "
                "focusing on the expression of Htrs RNA across approximately 4 million brain cells. The scRNA-seq dataset comprehensively encompassed all known 14 Htr subtypes. "
               f"{round(((exp>threshold_expression).sum(axis=1).astype(bool).sum()/exp.shape[0])*100,2)}% of cells expressed RNA of at least one Htr. "
               f"Prevalence of Htrs across the entire dataset was considerably different ranging from {expression_total.min()}% of {expression_total.idxmin()} "
               f"to {expression_total.max()}% of {expression_total.idxmax()} (Figure 1A). RNA of 6 Htr was found in less than 2.5% of the cells "
               f"({', '.join(expression_total[expression_total < 2.5].index.values)}). On the other hand, RNA of Htr1f, Htr2a and Htr2c was present in "
               f"at least 1 every 5 cells. Average amount of RNA expression also varied across receptors (Supplementary Figure 1A). "
               f"Interestingly, the variation in amount of RNA shared around half (R²={r_squared_prevalence_CPM}) of the variability with the prevalence, "
               f"i.e., genes found in more cells also tended "
               f"to be expressed more at the single cell level. "
               f"Beside the prevalence and amount of expression, also the distributionacross the brain was considerably different. This is exemplified "
               f"by looking at the distribution of the Htr1 and Htr2 families on the uniform manifold approximations and projection (UMAP, Figure 1B). "
               f"The UMAP was color-coded according to neighborhood metadata. "
               f"Neighborhoods were defined both by location and neurotransmitter (Supplementary Figure 1B, Table 1). "
               f"When looking at the UMAP distributions for individual Htr, considerable differences were present also within each family of receptors (Supplementary Figure 2). "
               f"We analyzed these differences grouping cells by "
               f"neurotransmitter, neighborhoods or class. These categorizarions divided cells in a higlhy skewed manner (Supplementary Figure 1C), "
               f"for example when looking at groups by neurotransmitter release, "
               f"3 groups (Glut, Gaba and unassigned) made up for almost the totality of cells ({round((joined.groupby('neurotransmitter').size() / joined.shape[0])[['','Glut','GABA']].sum()*100,2)}%). "
               f"Expectedly, the vast majority of cells was classified as excitatory (Glut, {total_cells_by_neurotransmitter['Glut']}%) and "
               f"around 1 every 5 cells was found to release GABA ({total_cells_by_neurotransmitter['GABA']}%). All the other neurotransmitter were found in less than 1% of the cells, "
               f"in particular, 5-HT releasing neurons (Sero) were found in only {total_cells_by_neurotransmitter['Sero']}% of the cells. "
               f"Pattern of Htrs expression across different neurotransmitter groups exhibited a relatevely high Pearson correlation coefficient "
               f"(r={round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.stack().mean(),2)}±{round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.stack().sem(),2)}). "
               f"Sero and cholinergic neurons (Chol) showed the most distinct patterns of expression with respectively r={round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.mean()['Sero'],2)}±"
               f"{round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.sem()['Sero'],2)} and "
               f"r={round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.mean()['Chol'], 2)}±{round(corr_by_neurotransmitter.sem()['Chol'],2)} (Figure 1C). "
               f"To better evaluate the uniqueness of Htrs RNA expression per group we employed a Random Forest "
               f"Classifier aiming at decoding the grouping variable from the Htrs expression. "
               f"Overall accuracy of the model was {round(accuracy_neurotransmitter,2)}%. "
               f"Reflecting the correlation analysis, the confusion matrix showed that Sero and Chol were among the groups with "
               f"higher true positive (TP) rate (Sero={round(cm_neurotransmitter['Sero']['Sero'], 2)}%, "
               f"Chol={round(cm_neurotransmitter['Chol']['Chol'], 2)}%). Cells not expressing any neurotranmitter were also "
               f"identified succesfully ({round(cm_neurotransmitter[''][''], 2)}%). Moreover, Noradrenaline (Nora) and glycine (GABA-Glyc) releasing neurons "
               f"were identified at considerable levels (Nora={round(cm_neurotransmitter['Nora']['Nora'], 2)}% and "
               f"GABA-Glyc={round(cm_neurotransmitter['GABA-Glyc']['GABA-Glyc'], 2)}%). "
               f"To understand the contribution of each Htr in each prediction "
               "we calculated the mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for each receptor and neurotransmitter {Lundberg, 2017 #2921; Lundberg, 2020 #2922}. "
               "The SHAP values in association with the mean prevalence enable us "
               f"to understand the defining features of each group. Here we can see, for example, that the identification of Sero neurons "
               f"is determined mainly by expression of Htr1a and Chol neurons by Htr4 and Htr5b. Crucially, absence of expression can also contribute to the classification, e.g., "
               f"Cells not expressing any neurotransmitter are identified mainly by absence of any Htr. "
               f"When looking at different neighborhoods the accuracy of the model was {round(accuracy_neighborood,2)}%. "
               f"The model could differentiate best the NN-IMN-GC, TH-EPI-Glut and Pallium-Glut groups (NN-IMN-GC={round(cm_neighborood['NN-IMN-GC']['NN-IMN-GC'], 2)}%, "
               f"TH-EPI-Glut={round(cm_neighborood['TH-EPI-Glut']['TH-EPI-Glut'], 2)}% and Pallium-Glut={round(cm_neighborood['Pallium-Glut']['Pallium-Glut'], 2)}%, "
               f"Supplementary Figure 3A). "
               f"NN-IMN-GC includes all the cells not releasing any neurotransmitter, their classification is therefore predictably influenced by absence of any Htr. On the other hand, "
               f"TH-EPI-Glut cells were characterized by the unique combination of high expression of Htr7 and low expression of Htr2a and Htr4, "
               f"Pallium-Glut cells, instead, exhibited relatively low levels of Htr2c and Htr7. Notably, Htr7 and Htr1f seemed to follow opposite gradients across neighboroods."
               f"Across classes, differences in Htrs expression were more striking (Figure 1D). {report_class.loc['recall'][report_class.loc['recall']>.4].shape[0]} groups could be identified "
               f"with a TP rate >40%: {formatted_class_string} (Supplementary Figure 3B). 04 DG-IMN Glut were charachterized by high expression of Htr4 and absence of "
               f"the usually prevalent Htr2c. Similarly, 05 OB-IMN GABA cells "
               f"showed virtual absence of Htr2c as well as low Htr4 and high Htr1f expression; "
               f"09 CNU-LGE GABA cells showed high Htr1b and low Htr7/Htr1a; 17 MH-LH Glut exhibited high levels of Htr5b and Htr4"
               f"; 18 TH Glut showed high levels of Htr7 and virtual absence of Htr4; 22 MB-HB Sero, miroring the results showed by Sero neurons,"
               f" were charachterized by high levels of Htr1a; at last, 34 Immune cells "
               f"were identified by absence of any Htr expression. The use of only Htrs expression reached a unexpected {round(accuracy_class,2)}% accuracy in decoding classes. "
               f"Correlation between Htrs expression across the totality of cells ranged from {corr_by_cell.min().values[0]} ({'-'.join(corr_by_cell.idxmin())}) to {corr_by_cell.max().values[0]} "
               f"({'-'.join(corr_by_cell.idxmax())}). "
               f"Considerable correlation was also found for the {corr_by_cell.index[1]} (r={corr_by_cell.iloc[1].values[0]}) and "
               f"{corr_by_cell.index[2]} (r={corr_by_cell.iloc[2].values[0]}) pairs (Figure 1E). Interestingly, correlation patterns were not stable across neighboroods "
               f"(Supplementary Figure 4A). For example, Pallium-Glut exhibited a negative correlation between Htr4-Htr2a not evident from the entire dataset. Of note, TH-EPI-Glut showed the "
               f"highest absolute correlation across all neighboroods with r={correlation_TH_EPI.max().max()} between Htr5b-Htr4 and a unique negative correlation between Htr4-Htr7. "
               "To explore the underlying causes of the correlations we analyzed colocalization between Htrs using the same stringent threshold used by the original "
               "authors to determine neurotransmitter expression {Yao, 2023 #2828}. "
               f"Across the entire dataset we observed that the most expressed genes, Htr1f and Htr2c, were often colocalized with other genes (Figure 1G). "
               f"This was a driving factor for correlation. Looking more in detail across neighboroods, also here we noticed important differences, mainly explainable "

               f"2 Htrs (Figure 1F), therefore, only rarely a cell was found to express uniquely one Htr. Surprisingly, {round(at_least_5_receptors.mean().values[0], 2)}±{round(at_least_5_receptors.sem().values[0], 2)}% of cells expressed at least 5 Htrs. "
               f"The extensive expression across different Htr classes and the considerable coexpression within cells point at the complexity of the 5-HT system even "
               f"at the single cell dimension. "
               f"To facilitate an understanding of the downstream  cellular effects "
               f"of 5-HT we aggregated receptors according to their main intracellular effector. We aggregated Htr1 and Htr5 due to their inhibitory effect (cAMP decrerase);"
               f" Htr4, Htr6 and Htr7 because "
               f"of the shared downstream effect of increasing cAMP; Htr2 is the only one that causes an Ca2+ increase while Htr3 is the only ionotropic receptor. "
               f"For each cell we determined "
               f"the principal pathway activated by 5-HT by analyzing the amount of RNA for each Htr and, afterwards, we grouped cells across different neighborhoods (Figure 1H). "
               f"Ht3 were present only in a small minority of cortical inhibitory neurons. "
               f"In the telencephalon, the absolute majority of both Pallium-Glut "
               f"and Subpallium-Gaba cells were linked to Htr1/5, and around one quarter of cells instead featured Htr2 as primary effector. Subcortical cells exhibited "
               f"a more balanced partition without any absolute majority and a considerable presence of Htr4/6/7. "
               f"In the following sections we will take a deeper look at "
               "Htrs grouped by effector and we will take advantage of the spatial information provided by the MERFISH dataset of {Zhang, 2023 #2887} regarding 9 Htrs. ",

           "Htr1 & Htr5": u"Receptors belonging to these two families have an inhibitory effect on the host cell, they are coupled to G\u1D62 and cause a downstream decrease of cAMP "

                          "Htr1a co-localized most frequently with Htr1f, Htr2c and Htr2a (Figure 2B) and only in a minority of cases was expressed alone (<10%). "
                          "Expression across classes was highly correlated between the RNA-seq and MERFISH datasets (Figure 2A) and show an almost perfect proportional relationship. "
                          "Highest expression was found in 5-HT neurons of the mid- and hindbrain (class 22 MB-HB Sero, Figure 2C), nonetheless, cortical excitatory neurons (01 IT-ET Glut) "
                          "had the higher absolute number of cells expressing Ht1a. "
                          "To pinpoint the spatial location we first identified the clusters highly enriched with Htr1a RNA with "

                          "Looking at the spatial distribution across divisions, the highest prevalence was found in the pallidum (PAL) and hippocampus (HPF), two telencephalic regions (Figure 2D). "
