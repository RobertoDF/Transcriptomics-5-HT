introduction = ("5-HT stands as a pivotal neuromodulator within the brain, orchestrating a diverse array of behaviors and physiological "
                "processes that include mood regulation {Dayan, 2009 #1401}, memory {Teixeira, 2018 #924}, sleep {Oikonomou, 2019 #347}, feeding {Lee, 2010 #1406}"
                " and decision-making {Homberg, 2012 #1407}. This broad spectrum of influence is remarkably orchestrated by a limited number of 5-HT releasing "
                "neurons located in the raphe nuclei, which extend their projections across the entire brain {Descarries, 2010 #937}. The intricacy of the 5-HT "
                "system is amplified by the extensive repertoire of Htrs, each linked to distinct "
                "G protein-coupled intracellular pathways, resulting in varied and sometimes opposing effects on neuronal excitability {Marin, 2020 #2938}. "
                "These receptors are categorized into 14 types spread across 7 families, presenting a complex landscape of 5-HT signaling. "
                "To better grasp the impact of 5-HT release, it is crucial to accurately map the expression of each receptor "
                "among neurons and throughout different brain regions. "
                "Historically, techniques such as immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, in situ hybridization, and microarray analysis have been instrumental "
                "in shedding light on this question {Vilar√≥, 2020 #2939; Hawrylycz, 2012 #2940}. These methodologies have provided foundational insights into the brain-wide effects of 5-HT, "
                "contributing significantly to our current understanding {Salvan, 2023 #2941}. However, the introduction of single-cell RNA-seq and MERFISH has revolutionized "
                "our ability to dissect gene transcription. Unlike their predecessors, these techniques offer an unparalleled resolution and depth of profiling, "
                "allowing for the intricate detailing of each Htr's expression patterns. This advanced level of detail enriches our comprehension of 5-HT's roles, "
                "paving the way for more precise and nuanced interpretations of its influence across neural circuits. "
                "To elucidate the complexities of the distribution of each Htr subtype, we utilized an RNA-seq dataset provided by the Allen Institute {Yao, 2023 #2828}, "
                "incorporating the associated hierarchical clustering of cells at four nested levels. Spatial distribution data was obtained from "
                "a MERFISH dataset by Harvard University {Zhang, 2023 #2887}. This approach revealed new patterns of Htrs "
                "transcription and set a new benchmark for examining their distribution "
                "against the backdrop of existing literature, deepening our understanding of the complex roles of 5-HT in brain function. "
                "To facilitate broader custom exploration of the Htr landscape throughout the brain, "
                "we have developed an online visualization tool that enables the seamless exploration of both the RNA-seq and MERFISH dataset at different levels of "
                "granularity, providing a comprehensive view of the 5-HT receptor distribution. ")
