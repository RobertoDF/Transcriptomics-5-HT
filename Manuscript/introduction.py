introduction = ("In the quest to elucidate the intricate landscape of neurotransmission, Htrs emerge as pivotal molecular conduits, "
                "orchestrating a myriad of physiological processes, including mood regulation, cognition, and sleep. The diverse family of Htrs, "
                "classified into seven distinct classes (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), exhibits a complex pattern of distribution across various tissues, underscoring "
                "their multifaceted roles in human health and disease. The recent unveiling of a comprehensive RNA atlas, as reported in Nature, "
                "offers an unprecedented opportunity to delve deeper into the expression patterns of these crucial receptors. This atlas, encompassing the entire brain, "
                "serves as a foundational resource for mapping the transcriptomic landscape with unparalleled detail and scope. Here, we harness the potential of this RNA atlas "
                "to systematically investigate the distribution patterns of Htrs across the mouse brain. By leveraging the high-resolution data contained within the atlas, "
                "our aim is to dissect the cell type-specific expression profiles of each Htr subtype. "
                "This endeavor not only promises to refine our understanding of the physiological roles played by these receptors but also "
                "to uncover novel insights into their involvement in neurological disorders. "
                "Furthermore, by integrating our findings with existing knowledge on serotonin signaling pathways, we anticipate identifying "
                "potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for neuropsychiatric conditions.")
