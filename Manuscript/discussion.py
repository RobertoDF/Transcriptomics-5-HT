              "Htr1a is expressed in an important fraction of Sero neurons of the raphe and some HPF excitatory neurons. "
              "Htr1b is expressed in a many inhibitory striatal neurons and raphe Sero neurons. "
              "Htr1d, similarly to Htr1b, is expressed in the striatum, although at much lower levels. "
              "Htr1f is widely expressed in telencephalic structures,especially the Isocortex, with a peak in frontal olfactory structures. "
              "Htr2a is prevalent in glutamatergic cells of the cortical subplate (CLA and EPd) and the mammillary bodies (TMd, PMd), neurons of the BA, a variety of cortical neurons and hippocampal interneurons. "
              "Htr2b is rarely transcribed and is present in some neurons of the pineal gland. "
              "Htr2c is broadly transcribed, especially in the STR, excitatory neurons of the amygdala (LA, BLA and BMA) and RSPv, OLF neurons and structures in MB, P, MY and CB. "
              "Htr3a and Htrbb are uniquely observed in cortical gabaergic neurons of the 06 CTX-CGE GABA class. "
              "Htr4 is transcribed at high levels in the OT, excitatory cells of hippocampus proper (CA2. CA3) and DG, and Chol Neurons of the TH (17 MH-LH Glut). "
              "Htr5a is transcribed at low levels with only one enriched cluster in the MB. "
              "Htr5b iss also transcribed only in few cells, specifically in Chol neurons of the TH. "
              "Htr6 does not feature any enriched cluster, some cells in CA3 expressed this Htr. "
              "Htr7 is widely expressed in subcortical structures, especially in some TH nuclei (PF, PVT, IAD and PT) the mammillary complex (MM and PMd),"
              " the lateral septal nucleus (LSv) and the fasciola cinerea of the HPF. "
              "With this work we aimed at analyzing the information pertaining to the 5-HT system contained in "
              "the RNA-seq and MERFISH dataset provided respectively by {Yao, 2023 #2828} and {Zhang, 2023 #2887}. "

              "The granularity of the analyisis here reported "
              "is limited by costrains intrisic of a traditional scientific article. To get arounfd this limitation we built a custom online visalizer "
              "that enable the inspection of Htrs RNA expression at across different levels of cluatering and space. For example , it is possible to "
              "see the prevalence across each brain structure of every Htr. ") \
